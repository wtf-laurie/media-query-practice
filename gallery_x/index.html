<h1>Gallery X</h1>

<p>(we don’t eXist)<br>
Gallery X is an imaginary gallery, created for the purposes of this web typography exercise. If it did exist, it would be dedicated to showcasing type and lettering through the ages. While web typographers work in HTML and CSS, our craft is built upon the foundation created by letterers, printers, typographers, and type designers who came before us.</p>

<h3>The Lindisfarne Gospels</h3>
<p>Through April 16, 2017<br>
Harrington Hall<br>
The Lindisfarne Gospels is an illuminated manuscript, its pages filled with examples of elaborately and skillfully hand-rendered patterns and decorations. Produced sometime between 710 and 721, in a monastery off the coast of Northumberland at Lindisfarne, the manuscript is thought to be the work of a single scribe. With the original on display in the British Library in London, this travelling exhibit features a facsimile of the original. It is accompanied by poster-sized, high resolution photographic prints of some of the most intricate, ornate (original) pages.</p>

<h3>Filippo Tommaso Marinetti</h3>
<p>Opening January 28, 2017<br>
Carnegie Gallery<br>
An Italian poet, editor, art theorist, fascist, and founder of the Futurist movement, Marinetti declared in his manifesto: “Courage, audacity, and revolt will be the essential elements of our poetry… We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind… We affirm that the world’s magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed.” He promoted a new kind of poetry, enhancing the expressive power of his writing with a loose construction of words. Influenced by his experience as a reporter in the Balkan conflict in 1912–13, much of Marinetti’s work conveyed something of the emotional tone or sensation of war.</p>
